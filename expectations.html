            <h3>
                What are Norms?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Those of you who are new to the idea of "norms" may be familiar with a concept called "rules" and you may even be tempted to believe that these so-called class norms are the same thing as rules. However, there is a subtle but important difference. "Rules" are limitations that are imposed upon us, that we are made to follow, possibly against our will or better judgement. Sometimes rules are important to keep us safe! You probably wouldn't want to drive your car in a city with no traffic rules! But other times, rules can be needlessly restrictive because not everybody gets a say in them.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my classroom, whenever possible we will opt for norms instead of rules. Norms are limitations we all agree to follow together in order to make our lives better, and they are different than rules because everyone gets to help decide on them. In the first day or two of each class, we will work together to come up with a list of norms that we think will help ensure we are able to achieve our learning goals, and that everyone feels respected and valued in class. If, at any point during the year, you or a classmate's needs are not being met and you would like to propose a change to the norms, you may come talk to me or send me an email and we will figure out if there is some way we can make it better. I might also arrange "class meetings" on occassion if I feel as if the norms are not being respected or if there is a problem we need to fix.
            </p>

            <p>
                That said, below is a list of all the rules that are not negotiable and which we must abide by.
            </p>
            <h3>
                School-Wide Policies
            </h3>
            <p>
                These policies are decided by the school administration and every classroom needs to follow them.
            </p>
            <div class="bubble">
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        No phones in class.
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        If I see phones out in class, I will demand that you put them away. If you find it too distracting to have your phone on your person in class, you may voluntarily hand it to me during class and I will keep it safe until class is over.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        No more than one student may be excused from the room at a time during class. 
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        We will do our best to follow this rule, however I understand that emergencies do happen and can be embarrassing to talk about so if you do need to leave urgently for any reason, just let me know that you are leaving and you can go.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        You may not leave the room during the first 10 minutes or last 10 minutes of class.
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        As with the previous rule, just let me know if it is an emergency.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </div>
            
            

            <h3>
                Class Rules
            </h3>
            <p>
                These are rules that I have decided specifically for my classes, and they are mainly here to make class run more smoothly and help everyone feel safe in this space.
            </p>
            <div class="bubble">
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        Use your communication skills.
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Whether you are upset at a classmate or you think one of my assignments is dumb, the best way to handle it is always to communicate. I will not tolerate violence or threats of any kind in my classroom.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>
                        Log in to your computers and learning platform as soon as you get to class.
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        It only takes a minute or two to do this but over a whole school year all that time can add up, and we have so much to cover! If we all make sure to take care of this as soon as we get to our seats, we will be able to do so much more with our time together and that means more time for fun stuff at the end of the year.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </div>

            <h3>
                What happens if I <span style="color:red;">break</span> the rules/norms?
            </h3>
            <p>
                My first priority is making sure everyone feels safe and welcomed in my classroom, so if you engage in behavior that is harmful or threatening to others, whether you meant it or not, you will be removed from the classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                My second priority is to address whatever caused the behavior in the first place. This will typically take the form of a private conversation between me and you, but in rare cases may result in trips to the counselors office, mediated conversations with classmates, or calls home. I do these things not as punishments but to make sure that whatever communication is missing between us is taken care of and your needs are being met in the classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                My one exception to this policy is <strong>cheating</strong>, which I take very seriously. I do my best to make sure your grade reflects how much you have learned in my class, and not just how good you are at taking tests or doing work. If you are concerned about your grade or if you are struggling to understand what's going on in class, I encourage you to come talk to me or email me so that we can work out a way for you to succeed. There should be no reason to cheat in my class, so if you are found to have cheated on any assignment or aided anyone else in cheating, you will recieve a non-negotiable zero for that assignment and we will have a conversation about what to do differently next time. We will go over in detail what constitutes cheating at the beginning of each year.
