            <h2>
                First Days of School
            </h2>
            <p>
                In our first days together, we will get to know each other by creating name tags and sharing our answers to the questions: "Why are you here?" and "What brings you joy?" It is my belief that these questions will help bring to the surface important aspects of our identities and motivations so that we can start to connect with each other on a deeper level, and so that I can start to shape the rest of the course around those motivations. Whether students are here because they are passionate about computing as a form of self expression, or as a gateway to a career, or just because their parent/friend asked them to be here will make a big impact on how I structure the course content.

                To reinforce the notion that this is an inclusive space where everyone should feel like they belong, we will be doing the "Draw a Scientist" activity where students draw what comes to mind for them when they imagine a scientist (computer scientist in this case) and after engage in a discussion about stereotypes and biases in CS.

                One of the unique aspects of a computer science classroom in the current day and age is the immense variety of skill sets that students come into the class with. Some students may have been playing around with coding in their free time or in extracurricular clubs for many years, while many students will come in as complete beginners. In order to build an environment which is both welcoming and challenging to all students, regardless of their prior experience, I will establish a norm in the class that we are here to help each other rather than compete with each other, and that students who are ahead in their work have a responsibility to help their classmates when they are struggling. We will also set up the classroom space if possible with computers along the perimeter of the room and a large open desk space in the center so that there is no hiding what's going on on our screens and so that we can transition from individual computer work to group activities just by swiveling around in our seats, and to overall make the room feel like one big collaborative space rather than a series of discrete little islands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing that is important to establish early on is motivation for why the course content is important and relevant, so we will spend the first few days of class exploring the history of technology and various examples of how the skills we are going to learn have been employed in practice to create an impact on the world, for better or for worse.
