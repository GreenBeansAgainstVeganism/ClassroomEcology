            <h3>Why take this class?</h3>
            <p>
                This is a class about programming! What sets modern computers apart from almost all other technology is their ability to be programmed. However, that's typically not how we interact with them any more! Most of us interact with computers on a daily basis, (you are probably doing so right this moment!) but we only do so through apps and games that other people have made for us. There is a whole world of possibilities that remains hidden right under our noses unless we learn to speak the languages that computers were designed to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this course, we will cover the fundamentals of coding in Java, a well-known object-oriented programming language that is used for everything from desktop and android apps to video games. We will learn to write algorithms to do cool stuff like apply custom filters to images or play tic tac toe, and even pursue personal coding projects of our own determination. Beyond that, however, we will learn all the skills that we need to continue pursuing programming on our own, whether as a career or as a hobby. I don't know everything there is to know about programming. I don't even know 1%. Nobody does! The world of programming is one never-ending sea of new ideas and technologies, so rather than trying to memorize it all, our job instead will be to learn how to think like a programmer and figure things out in spite of what we don't know.
            </p>
            <p>
                This class is intended to be a more comprehensive deep dive into the world of programming compared to Intro to Programming, but we will still start from the very basics, so whether you are a coding veteran looking to take your skills to the next level or a complete beginner, AP Computer Science Algorithms is the class for you!

                Assignments and Grading:
            </h3>
            <p>
                The work this course will mainly fall into the following categories:
                <div class="bubble">
                    <dl>
                        <dt>
                            Coding Assignments
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            These are where you will get to put your coding skills to practice and write a program or piece of a program to accomplish some given task. You will be graded based on whether your program works as specified and on the style and readability of your code. Each assignment will generally be very specific about what it wants you to do, but you will have a little opportunity at the end to exercise your creativity and have some fun with the code.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>
                            Exit Tickets
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            At the end of almost every day, you will recieve a slip of paper with one to two short questions on it related to what we covered that day. These should take less than 15 minutes to complete and are graded based on completion. They are mostly just to help me see how you are thinking about the concepts, and also for you to give me feedback on the lessons.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>
                            Practice AP Exams
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            This is an AP class, and so to prepare you as best as I can for the environment of the test, we will end each unit with an exam in the style of the AP test but shorter. I want these to be as low-stress as possible while still being good practice for the real deal, so you will not be allowed notes on the exams, however you will have several opportunities to revise your answers later if you are not happy with your score.
                        </dd>
                        <dt>
                            Personal Coding Project
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            Towards the end of the year, after AP Exams, we will all design, plan, and build our own coding projects from scratch. I really want everyone to walk away from this class feeling like they know how to write a complete program rather than just snippets of code, so this project will be worth a significant portion of your grade. Don't worry though, because this assignment is incredibly free-form and you can take it in whatever direction most interests you. My hope is that it will feel more like fun than work, and you might even want to continue working on it after the class has ended!

            <h3>
                Academic Integrity:
            </h3>
            <p>
                In Computer Science, we have a culture of borrowing and stealing code from each other all the time over the internet. There is nothing wrong with using someone else's code! I even encourage it! However, I ask two things of you:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Always cite your sources. Claiming work you did not do as your own is <strong>plagiarism</strong>, whether you're writing an essay for Humanities or a computer program. If you borrow code from a person or AI online, please leave a note in your assignment of what was borrowed as well as a link to where you got it if applicable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure you understand what you are borrowing and you're not just copying things blindly. The whole point of this class is to learn computer science, and copying is not learning. If you are attempting to pass this class without actually learning, that is <strong>cheating</strong>. You should be prepared to give thorough explanations of how your code works for everything that you turn in. If you would like help understanding some code, even code you wrote, please feel free to ask me or a peer.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I take academic integrity very seriously, so if you are found to have plagiarised or cheated on any assignment, you will recieve a non-negotiable zero for that assignment.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Inclusivity:
            </h3>
            <p>
                <strong>I firmly believe that there is space for everyone in the world of CS, no matter your background, identity, or level of comfort with CS.</strong> Unfortunately, CS has historically been made inaccessible to many groups of people and we are still dealing with these issues today. In the interest of putting an end to these cycles of exclusion and prejudice, I ask us in this class to reconsider our ideas of what it means to be a computer scientist, and to think critically about ways that we can expand that definition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ensuring that this classroom is a safe and welcoming place to all is a mission that requires care and hard work from all of us. I ask us all to support each other in creating a <strong>brave space</strong> in our classroom where we allow each other to be vulnerable, to ask for help, to admit when we make mistakes, and to learn from the wisdom that exists in our peers, because that is how we grow, and we all know how hard it is to do those things without feeling supported by everyone around us.
