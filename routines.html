                Classroom Routines and Procedures
            </h2>
            <p>
                Here you'll find all you need to know about what a typical day looks like in our classroom!
            </p>
            <h3>
                Daily Routines

                <h4>
                    Start of Class
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The first thing you should do when you get to class is get your laptop out and make sure you have open your learning platform and your code editor. We will be using these two applications almost every day and if we all make a habit of getting them open as soon as we arrive, that little bit of time we save every day will add up over the course of the year.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once you have these two things ready, you may chat amongst yourselves and check in with your neighbors.

                <h4>
                    Warmup Exercise
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Most days when you walk into class, there will be a warm up exercise on the board. We will have time at the beginning of class for everyone to do the warm up, but if you're waiting for class to start and have nothing else to do, go ahead and try the warm up!
                </p>

                <h4>
                    During the Lesson
                </h4>
                <p>
                    People tend to think of computer science as a class where everyone is just typing away on their computers all by themselves all day, but that's not how we do things in this class because we are a community of learners! There will be group work. There will be moving around. You will never have the same group twice unless it is for a multi-day project. My goal is that you all get the opportunity to know and work with everyone else in the room because that is how we build a strong community.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Exit Tickets
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Almost every day before you leave class, you will be asked to fill out a short, 5 minute exit ticket which will count towards your participation for that day. However, exit tickets in my class are much more than just a participation grade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The exit ticket is your opportunity to give me feedback on how class went. If you think I could be doing something better, or if there is a topic you want me to cover more in depth, please tell me! I read over all of your exit tickets after each class and I use them to help adjust my lessons for the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The exit ticket is also an opportunity for you to show me you are thinking deeply about the concepts in class. If you are concerned about your grade at the end of the semester and you want to argue to me that you deserve a better grade or another chance, I am going to ask you for proof that you have been trying hard in class, and your responses to these exit tickets are a great place to create that proof.
